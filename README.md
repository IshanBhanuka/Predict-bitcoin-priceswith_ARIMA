# Predicting Bitcoin Prices with ARIMA Model

## Description
This project demonstrates how to predict Bitcoin prices using the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model. The ARIMA model is a popular time series forecasting technique that can capture the temporal dependencies in the data and make predictions accordingly.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.11
- pandas
- NumPy
- matplotlib
- statsmodels

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is sourced from [yfinance](https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/) library. You can find the dataset there.

## Results
The ARIMA model achieved a Mean absolute percentage error:0.23149826581189709 on the test dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in predicting Bitcoin prices.

## Credits
This project is based on the tutorial "Using ARIMA to Predict Bitcoin Prices in Python in 2023ðŸ”´" by *Financial Programming with Ritvik, CFA*. You can watch the tutorial [here](https://youtu.be/pryXhOgDY9A?si=nZschzOMAYo0InDE).
